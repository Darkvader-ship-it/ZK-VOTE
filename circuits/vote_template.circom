// DAO domain separation tag for commitment scheme
// SHA-256("ZK-VOTE-COMMITMENT") reduced mod BN254 scalar field
// Prevents cross-protocol attacks where commitments from other systems
// could be valid in ZK-VOTE

// DaoVote Anonymous Vote Circuit
//
// Proves:
// 1. Voter knows secret & salt that hash to a commitment (leaf) in the Merkle tree
// 2. Nullifier is correctly derived from secret, daoId, and proposalId (domain-separated)
// 3. Vote choice (candidate index) is within [0, numCandidates)
//
// Public signals: [root, nullifier, daoId, proposalId, voteChoice, numCandidates]
// Private signals: secret, salt, blindingFactor, pathElements, pathIndices
//
// PRIVACY: Commitment is NOT exposed publicly. Votes are fully unlinkable across proposals.
// Revocation is enforced via Merkle tree updates (zeroing leaves) rather than on-chain checks.
//
// SECURITY: numCandidates is a public input so the contract can verify the circuit enforced
// the same candidate bound that the election was configured with. Without this binding,
// a prover could supply a proof valid under one numCandidates value while the contract
// tallies using a different (potentially larger) count.
