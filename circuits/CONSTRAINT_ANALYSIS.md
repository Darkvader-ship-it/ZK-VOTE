# Circuit Constraint Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the ZK-VOTE circuits for under-constrained signals and documents all constraints to ensure circuit security.

## Under-Constrained Signal Vulnerabilities

Under-constrained signals are intermediate values in a circuit that are not fully determined by the constraints. This allows a prover to choose different values while still satisfying all constraints, potentially proving false statements.

### Common Patterns

1. **Assignment without constraint**: Using `<--` without corresponding `===`
2. **Missing range checks**: Not constraining values to valid ranges
3. **Unused signals**: Signals declared but not constrained
4. **Weak comparisons**: Comparison operations that don't fully constrain outputs

## Vote Circuit Analysis (vote.circom)

### Signals and Constraints

#### Public Inputs

```circom
signal input root;              // Merkle tree root
signal input nullifier;         // Prevents double voting
signal input daoId;             // DAO identifier
signal input proposalId;        // Proposal identifier
signal input voteChoice;        // 0 or 1
```

**Constraints**: All public inputs are constrained by the prover/verifier protocol.

#### Private Inputs

```circom
signal input secret;            // Voter's secret
signal input salt;              // Random salt
signal input pathElements[levels];   // Merkle proof siblings
signal input pathIndices[levels];    // Merkle proof path (0 or 1)
```

**Constraints**:

- `pathIndices[i]` MUST be binary (0 or 1) - ✓ Constrained in merkle_tree.circom
- `pathElements[i]` are field elements - ✓ Implicitly constrained by field arithmetic
- `secret` and `salt` are field elements - ✓ Implicitly constrained

### Constraint 1: Commitment Computation

```circom
component commitmentHasher = Poseidon(2);
commitmentHasher.inputs[0] <== secret;
commitmentHasher.inputs[1] <== salt;
signal commitment;
commitment <== commitmentHasher.out;
```

**Analysis**: ✓ FULLY CONSTRAINED

- Poseidon hash is deterministic
- Output is assigned with `<==` (constrained assignment)
- No under-constraint risk

### Constraint 2: Merkle Tree Verification

```circom
component merkleProof = MerkleTreeInclusionProof(levels);
merkleProof.leaf <== commitment;
for (var i = 0; i < levels; i++) {
    merkleProof.pathElements[i] <== pathElements[i];
    merkleProof.pathIndices[i] <== pathIndices[i];
}
root === merkleProof.root;
```

**Analysis**: ✓ FULLY CONSTRAINED

- All inputs to Merkle proof are constrained
- Root equality is enforced with `===`
- See detailed analysis in merkle_tree.circom section

### Constraint 3: Nullifier Computation

```circom
component nullifierHasher = Poseidon(3);
nullifierHasher.inputs[0] <== secret;
nullifierHasher.inputs[1] <== daoId;
nullifierHasher.inputs[2] <== proposalId;
nullifier === nullifierHasher.out;
```

**Analysis**: ✓ FULLY CONSTRAINED

- All inputs constrained
- Output equality enforced with `===`
- Domain separation via daoId and proposalId

### Constraint 4: Vote Choice Binary Check

```circom
voteChoice * (voteChoice - 1) === 0;
```

**Analysis**: ✓ FULLY CONSTRAINED

- Enforces `voteChoice ∈ {0, 1}`
- Algebraic constraint: `v(v-1) = 0` only holds for v=0 or v=1
- No under-constraint risk

## Merkle Tree Circuit Analysis (merkle_tree.circom)

### MerkleTreeInclusionProof Template

#### Inputs

```circom
signal input leaf;                      // Leaf value
signal input pathElements[levels];      // Sibling hashes
signal input pathIndices[levels];       // Path bits (0=left, 1=right)
```

#### Critical Constraint: Path Index Binary Check

```circom
// Ensure pathIndices is binary (0 or 1)
pathIndices[i] * (pathIndices[i] - 1) === 0;
```

**Analysis**: ✓ FULLY CONSTRAINED

- Enforces each `pathIndices[i] ∈ {0, 1}`
- Prevents invalid path encoding
- Critical for security: without this, prover could use fractional values

### Selector Template

```circom
template Selector() {
    signal input in[2];
    signal input s;
    signal output out[2];

    out[0] <== (in[1] - in[0]) * s + in[0];
    out[1] <== (in[0] - in[1]) * s + in[1];
}
```

**Analysis**: ✓ FULLY CONSTRAINED

- Mathematical swap based on selector bit
- When s=0: out[0]=in[0], out[1]=in[1]
- When s=1: out[0]=in[1], out[1]=in[0]
- Relies on s being binary (enforced by caller)
- Uses constrained assignment `<==`

### Hash Computation

```circom
hashers[i] = Poseidon(2);
hashers[i].inputs[0] <== selectors[i].out[0]; // left
hashers[i].inputs[1] <== selectors[i].out[1]; // right
currentHash[i + 1] <== hashers[i].out;
```

**Analysis**: ✓ FULLY CONSTRAINED

- All hash inputs are constrained
- Output assignment uses `<==`
- Deterministic hash function

## Additional Security Checks

### Range Checks

The circuits currently rely on field arithmetic for range checks. All values are implicitly bounded by the BN254 scalar field modulus `r`.

**Recommendation**: Explicit range checks for:

- `candidateIndex` (if added) should be < candidateCount
- `daoId` and `proposalId` should be reasonable values

### Signal Usage Verification

All signals in the circuits are used:

- ✓ `secret` - used in commitment and nullifier
- ✓ `salt` - used in commitment
- ✓ `pathElements` - used in Merkle proof
- ✓ `pathIndices` - used in Merkle proof
- ✓ `voteChoice` - constrained to binary and output as public

### Poseidon Hash Security

The circuits use Poseidon hash from circomlib:

- ✓ Standard implementation (audited by Trail of Bits)
- ✓ Compatible with Stellar P25 on-chain Poseidon (BN254)
- ✓ Collision-resistant
- ✓ Properly constrained

## Automated Analysis Tools

```

Detects:

- Constraints that don't match intent
- Missing constraints
- Redundant constraints

## Test Cases for Under-Constrained Bugs

### Test 1: Invalid Path Index

```javascript
// Should FAIL: pathIndices[i] = 0.5
const witness = {
  pathIndices: [0, 0.5, 1, 0, ...]  // Invalid!
};
// Expected: Constraint violation
```

### Test 2: Invalid Vote Choice

```javascript
// Should FAIL: voteChoice = 2
const witness = {
  voteChoice: 2, // Invalid!
};
// Expected: Constraint violation at voteChoice * (voteChoice - 1) === 0
```

### Test 3: Nullifier Mismatch

```javascript
// Should FAIL: Nullifier doesn't match secret+daoId+proposalId
const witness = {
  nullifier: randomValue, // Doesn't match Poseidon(secret, daoId, proposalId)
};
// Expected: Constraint violation
```

### Test 4: Root Mismatch

```javascript
// Should FAIL: Claimed root doesn't match Merkle computation
const witness = {
  root: randomValue, // Doesn't match Merkle proof result
};
// Expected: Constraint violation
```

## Security Audit Recommendations

1. ✅ All `<--` assignments have corresponding `===` constraints
2. ✅ Binary values (`pathIndices`, `voteChoice`) are constrained to {0,1}
3. ✅ All hash outputs are properly constrained
4. ✅ No unused signals
5. ✅ Merkle proof path indices are binary-checked
6. ⚠️ Consider explicit range checks for daoId/proposalId (optional)
7. ✅ All public inputs are properly constrained

## Constraint Count Summary

Vote circuit (18 levels):

- Poseidon constraints: ~2 hashes × 150 = 300 constraints
- Merkle proof: 18 levels × (1 selector + 1 hash) = 18 × 200 = 3,600 constraints
- Binary checks: 18 (pathIndices) + 1 (voteChoice) = 19 constraints
- **Total**: ~4,000 constraints

This is well within Groth16 limits and produces compact proofs (~200 bytes).

## Conclusion

The ZK-VOTE circuits (`vote.circom` and `merkle_tree.circom`) have been analyzed for under-constrained signals. All critical signals are properly constrained:

1. ✅ Binary values (pathIndices, voteChoice) have explicit `v(v-1)=0` constraints
2. ✅ Hash computations use constrained assignments (`<==`)
3. ✅ All equality checks use strong constraints (`===`)
4. ✅ No unused signals
5. ✅ Merkle proof verification is fully constrained

**Security Status**: SECURE against under-constrained signal attacks.

**Recommended Actions**:

1. Run `circomspect` analysis during CI/CD
2. Add negative test cases to test suite
3. Document all constraint rationale in code comments
4. Consider formal verification for production
