/**
 * Regression coverage for #573's `route is not defined` claim.
 *
 * #573 claims `route is not defined` at src/middleware/metrics.ts:50.
 * Reading the current source shows this was already fixed — the file's own
 * doc comment ("Bug fix: the original version referenced `route` before it
 * was defined...") explains the fix directly: the in-flight gauge now uses
 * `inboundRoute` (derived from `req.path` before Express populates
 * `req.route`), while response-side metrics use the resolved
 * `req.route.path` on `finish`. This test exercises that exact code path so
 * a regression back to the old bug shows up as a thrown ReferenceError
 * instead of silently passing.
 *
 * Runs under the backend's node:test runner (tsx), matching
 * tests/logger.test.ts's style.
